# SPL-TOKEN SEARCH

link: https://zk13.xyz 

a search that utilizes the Dexscreener API to fetch Solana token data and display it in a simple UI.
simply paste the contract address of the spl token in the search bar and hit enter.
the contract address for the token can be found on solscan.io under token address.

many new spl tokens don't show their pricing within Solana wallets such as Phantom, and are also not recognized in aggregators such as Jupiter Aggregator.
this can make it hard to track the price for these tokens, and often leads to users opening many tabs on Dexscreener and RaydiumSwap.
this becomes especially tiresome when a user has many of these new spl tokens. 

spl-search was created to help users track their holdings in one place, with a simple, uncluttered UI.
only data most relevant to traders will be included, such as marketcap, liquidity, volume & a chart.
